<blockquote>Some 20 years ago I wanted to develop a tool to design VLSI chips.
I didn&#8217;t have a Forth for my new PC, so I thought I&#8217;d try a different
approach: machine language. Not assembler language, but actually typing the
hex instructions. [&#8230;] My conclusion was that Forth is more efficient than
machine language. Partly because of its interactivity and partly because of
its syntax.<br>&#8212;Charles Moore</blockquote>




<blockquote>My opinion is that OOP is one of the great frauds perpetrated on
the community. [&#8230;] OOP was designed so that its clients could claim superior
wisdom for being on the &#8220;inside&#8221;. The truth of the matter is that the single
most important aspect of OOP is an approach devised decades ago: encapsulation
of subroutines and data. All the rest is frosting.<br>&#8212;Thomas E.
Kurtz</blockquote>




<blockquote>The best way to avoid tough debugging is to write things very
carefully in the first place.<br>&#8212;Brian Kernighan</blockquote>




<blockquote>Software engineering is in many ways a very pathetic field,
because so much of it is anecdotal and based on people&#8217;s judgments or even
people&#8217;s aesthetic judgments.<br>&#8212;Peter Weinberger</blockquote>




<blockquote>C is a reasonably good language for compilers to generate, but the
idea that human beings should program in it is completely
absurd.<br>&#8212;Bertrand Meyer</blockquote>
