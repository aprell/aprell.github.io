I found an old note reminding me that I wanted to compile a list of my
favorite papers in the area of programming languages. So, at long last, here
we go. Rather than trying to summarize each paper in a few (or more)
sentences, I take the easy way out and only drop a few keywords to highlight
important contributions or outstanding explanations.

<!--more-->

- Peter J. Landin, [The Mechanical Evaluation of Expressions][1], 1964:
  applicative expressions, syntactic sugar, evaluation, environment, abstract
  machine ([Papers We Love presentation][2])

- Peter J. Landin, [The Next 700 Programming Languages][3], 1966: ISWIM family
  of programming languages, functional core, imperative features, equivalence
  rules, declarative languages. (This paper ends with the transcript of an
  interesting discussion that is still relevant today, over 50 years later.)

- John C. Reynolds, [Definitional Interpreters for Higher-Order Programming
  Languages][4], 1972 / 1998: meta-circular interpreter, defunctionalization,
  continuation-passing style ([Papers We Love presentation][5])

- Paul Hudak, [The Conception, Evolution, and Application of Functional
  Programming Languages][6], 1989: history of functional programming
  languages, including lambda calculus, Y combinator, order of evaluation,
  call by value, call by name, and call by need (lazy evaluation)

- Christopher Strachey, [Fundamental Concepts in Programming Languages][7],
  2000: L-values and R-values, call by value, call by reference, first-class
  objects, ad hoc polymorphism, parametric polymorphism ([Papers We Love
  presentation][8])

That's it for now. I hope to grow this list over time.
