A few interesting and amusing quotes from the book [Masterminds of
Programming][1]:

<blockquote>Some 20 years ago I wanted to develop a tool to design VLSI chips.
I didn't have a Forth for my new PC, so I thought I'd try a different
approach: machine language. Not assembler language, but actually typing the
hex instructions. [...] My conclusion was that Forth is more efficient than
machine language. Partly because of its interactivity and partly because of
its syntax.<br>---Charles Moore</blockquote>

<blockquote>My opinion is that OOP is one of the great frauds perpetrated on
the community. [...] OOP was designed so that its clients could claim superior
wisdom for being on the "inside". The truth of the matter is that the single
most important aspect of OOP is an approach devised decades ago: encapsulation
of subroutines and data. All the rest is frosting.<br>---Thomas E.
Kurtz</blockquote>

<blockquote>The best way to avoid tough debugging is to write things very
carefully in the first place.<br>---Brian Kernighan</blockquote>

<blockquote>Software engineering is in many ways a very pathetic field,
because so much of it is anecdotal and based on people's judgments or even
people's aesthetic judgments.<br>---Peter Weinberger</blockquote>

<blockquote>C is a reasonably good language for compilers to generate, but the
idea that human beings should program in it is completely
absurd.<br>---Bertrand Meyer</blockquote>
