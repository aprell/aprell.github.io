I'm a software engineer working on compiler and runtime support for parallel
computing.

[Here][Papers] is some of the stuff I've done in the past revolving around
programming multi- and manycore processors, especially [unconventional][Cell]
[ones][SCC].

These days, I'm interested in all things related to programming languages,
compilers, and runtime systems.
