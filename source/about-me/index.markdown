I enjoy programming multi- and manycore processors, especially [weird][Cell]
[ones][SCC]. I also like programming languages, compilers, and runtime
systems.

[Here][Papers] is some of the stuff I've worked on in the past. Since 2010,
I've helped teach a couple of classes on computer architecture, introductory
programming, and various compiler-related topics.
